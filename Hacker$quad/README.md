## This is some work that i've made for Hacker$quad

I'll make it open source to allow other people can use it

Arguments:

*binarie.exe* {Webhook.URL}

    If none url is set, set a default webhook included in the script

The webhook arguments are sended with application/json Discord-like webhook, use the embeds to send the stuff, ensure you're allowed to see URL previews.

Other applications such Guilded.gg may can accept the webhooks, but im not 100% secure.
